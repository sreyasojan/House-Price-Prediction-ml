# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using the Ames Housing dataset containing 79 explanatory variables. 
The objective was to build a robust regression model and derive business insights from housing data.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Log transformation of target variable
- Feature engineering (Total square footage, House age, etc.)
- Model comparison (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Feature importance analysis
- Business recommendations

## 📊 Final Model Performance (Tuned Gradient Boosting)
- MAE: 0.0896
- RMSE: 0.1369
- R²: 0.8995

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Key Insights
House prices are primarily driven by:
- Total square footage
- Overall construction quality
- Neighborhood desirability
- Garage and basement features
